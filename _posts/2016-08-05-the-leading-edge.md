The Australian Red Cross Blood Service has a plan- _At the Leading Edge_. Released in 2014, the five year plan outlines a strategy to achieve it's broader vision for the organisation for the immediate future. In this post I have pulled out a few important paragraphs from the strategic plan, as well as listed the broader business objectives. Research proposal and plans are well-received when directly linked to these objectives.

The document can be found online [here]({{site.url}}/uploads/Strategic-Plan-2014.pdf), or directly on the Australian Red Cross Blood Service website- http://www.donateblood.com.au/about.


## Strategic Direction 
_At the leading edge_ outlines the key areas of future focus for the Blood Service and articulates what needs to be achieved to be at the top of our game. It focuses our efforts to continue to deliver efficiencies across the organisation and within the sector more broadly. It also balances this drive by maximising the quality and safety of our products and services so health professionals can be confident that they ultimately improve the lives of patients. Finally, the plan recognises the extraordinary capabilities of our national network of assets and skills and lays out plans for us to maximise their impact across the blood and broader health sector, and internationally.

_At the leading edge_ clearly articulates the way the Blood Service will need to work in order to achieve these goals – we must develop closer partnerships with our customers and stakeholders in order to perform and deliver shared outcomes. Change will ultimately come through enhancing the way our people work and by providing the right systems to support them. Each area of the plan is backed by rigorous performance measures that have clear aspirational targets that will signal our success. For many of these, we have set targets that will position us among the best blood services in the world.
