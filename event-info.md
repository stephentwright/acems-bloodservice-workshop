This collaborative workshop aims to explore future research projects and build connections between researchers within ACEMS and the Red Cross Blood Service.
   
## Workshop Objective 
+ Stimulate and pitch disruptive research ideas- fresh eyes on old problems.
+ Identify potential collaborative research projects.
+ Explore projects for high quality partnership grants.
   
## Partnership Aims 
+ Conduct leading edge research that addresses real-world applied problems relevant to the Blood Service.
+ Explore disruptive or out-of-the-box research possibilities.
+ Boost academic profiles and careers :
  + co-branded research stories or case studies demonstrating leading edge technical analyses and solutions.
  + career development opportunities for mid-career and early-career researchers from both ACEMS and the Blood Services.
   
## Workshop Themes 
+ How-to apply leading edge science from within ACEMS to the blood collection context. For example:
  1. Optimal appointment scheduling strategies, i.e. What are the optimal booking schedules under current, future, and ideal operational metrics?
  2. Driver route scheduling for optimal collection and delivery of blood products, i.e. A modern take on the travelling salesman problem.
  3. Individualised safety screening questionnaires, i.e. Can recommendation engines be used for individualised safety screening questionnaires.
  4. Forecasting supply/demand of blood products and quantifying uncertainty.
  5. Identifying a sustainable donor panel using predictive analytics. 
  6. Beyond associations - using large linked administrative datasets to answer causal-type questions
+ Explore the Blood Services applied problem space to identify interesting research problems.
+ Other ACEMS research applicable to the collection, management & delivery of blood products.
