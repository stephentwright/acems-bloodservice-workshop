To get the most out of the workshop we would like to foster pre-workshop discussions and introductions.  Please introduce yourself and your research area on the [introductions](https://stephentwright.github.io/acems-bloodservice-workshop/2016-08-09-welcome/) page, and add comments to the bottom of this page to indicate which of the research themes you are interested in or have questions about.

   
The themes are meant as a focus and general guide for the workshop, but comments ideas and suggestions outside of these main themes are encouraged. 

   
### Workshop Themes 
1. How-to apply leading edge science from within ACEMS to the blood collection context. For example:
     1. Optimal appointment scheduling strategies, i.e. What are the optimal booking schedules under current, future, and ideal operational metrics?
     2. Driver route scheduling for optimal collection and delivery of blood products, i.e. A modern take on the travelling salesman problem.
     3. Individualised safety screening questionnaires, i.e. Can recommendation engines be used for individualised safety screening questionnaires.
     4. Forecasting supply/demand of blood products and quantifying uncertainty.
     5. Identifying a sustainable donor panel using predictive analytics. 
     6. Beyond associations - using large linked administrative datasets to answer causal-type questions
2. Explore the Blood Services applied problem space to identify interesting research problems.
3. Other ACEMS research applicable to the collection, management & delivery of blood products.
